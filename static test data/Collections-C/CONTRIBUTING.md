# Contributing

To get started, fork the repo to your account and then clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Collections-C.git
```
Now you can start working on the project. 

* if you're planing to work on some major new feature, you might want to open an issue first so that it can discuss it.
* If you are writing code, you should follow the code [fomatting style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#K.26R_style). 
* Major changes should go into the development branch.



After you're done with your work, you should make sure that the tests are passing with:
```bash
make check
```
Commit your work and push it to your fork.

You can then open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from your fork to the upstream repository. After the pull request is made, we will comment / review it and might also suggest some changes. After all that is done, the pull request is merged.


## Finding something to work on
There is always something to work on, be it fixing bugs, writing documentation or adding cool new features. You can start by looking through the [issues](https://github.com/srdja/Collections-C/issues) to find something intereseting.
If you have a cool new idea, or you've found a bug and there is no issue for it, go ahead and open a [new issue](https://github.com/srdja/Collections-C/issues/new) for it.

If you're just starting out, look for issues with a [low-hanging fruit](https://github.com/srdja/Collections-C/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22low-hanging+fruit%22) tag. These issues should be fairly easy to fix, and they are also a good starting point for contributing.
